Assignment on financial planning
Please note, my Monte Carlo simulation keeps giving me a Performance Warning at Line 100. I reached out for assistance 4 times: twice with AskBCS, once with my TA, and also with my Class Instructor. Sadly, none were able to assist in correcting the error message but my instructor told me to give you the heads up on the Performance Warning. The simulation output is off, from a relative perspective, due to this warning. Thank you.
